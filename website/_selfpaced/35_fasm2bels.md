Using fasm2bels would be a useful activity because it would:
* It is a 2nd Symbiflow repo with its own install instructions to get them use to the idea of Symbiflow having multiples
* Provide an example of a program that uses the prjxray database
* Show them Verilog schematics and introduce Xilinx primitives - something they will have never seen before
* Help them see the complete cycle - they could go from behavioral Verilog --> Vivado --> bitstream --> FASM --> Verilog Schematic --> Vivado --> bitstream
