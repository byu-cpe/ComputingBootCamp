## Conclusion
Github is a powerful tool for both personal projects and collaborative work. This module covered some basic usage; it is highly recommended that you take time to complete the follow-up activities as well as think about how your work on a separate project could be enhanced by using Github for version control.

## Follow-Up Activities

Here are a few ideas for follow-up activities:

- Start a new repo on GitHub and explore the features
- Take one of your existing projects and back it up using Github from the terminal
  - Experiment with pushing to main, creating and pushing to branches, merging branches, adding an issue, submitting pull requests, and reviewing merge conflicts within your project.

Once you feel more confident:

- Fork an interesting repo
- Submit a pull request to an open-source project
