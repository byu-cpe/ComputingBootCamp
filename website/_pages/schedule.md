## General Computing Group


The boot camp will follow a mix of live presentations, live Q&A sessions, and offline modules.  **We will be meeting M/W/F in EB 325 at 2-3:30p (Mountain Time)** for all live presentations and live Q&A sessions.
  * **Live Talk:** This will consist of faculty presentation on a topic.  After the presentation, you should visit the boot camp page and complete the follow up activities.  
  * **Live Q&A:** For certain topics we already have videos from previous year's boot camp.  Please watch the videos and start working on the followup activities *before* attending the live Q&A.  Come to the Q&A session with questions you have, or to share what you've learned with your fellow students.
  * **Offline:** Several topics will be completed entirely offline on Tuesdays/Thursdays.  You should watch the video on the topic and complete the activities.
