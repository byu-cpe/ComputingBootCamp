The following procedure gives detailed steps for how to program a Nexys 4 DDR board with
a microblaze soft processor and run code on that same processor. It assumes that the board file
for the Nexys 4 DDR board is already downloaded and added to vivado.

## Create a New Vivado Project
*  Run Vivado (`vivado`) from terminal
*  Create Project
*  Click Next
*  Choose a project name and location and click next
*  Choose RTL Project and check "Do not specify sources at this time" and click next
*  At the top of the window select Boards
*  From the list of boards highlight the Nexys4 DDR and click next
  *  If the board is not shown in the list, you need to download and add the board file to vivado. 
  *  Follow the steps towards the bottom of [this](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/installing-vivado-and-sdk) tutorial for instructions on how to obtain and add the board file
*  Click Finish
## Create Block Design
*  On the left in the Flow Navigator, under IP INTEGRATOR, select "Create Block Design"
*  Choose a design name and click OK
*  Select the board tab

*  Right click on the Push Buttons entry
*  Select Connect Board Component
*  In the popup, select Create new IP -> AXI GPIO -> GPIO and click OK

<img src = "{% link media/microblaze/Block_diagram.png %}" width="800">

*  In the board tab, right click on the LEDs
*  Select Connect Board Component
*  In the popup, select existing IP -> axi_gpio_0 -> GPIO2 and click OK
*  In the board tab, right click on System Clock
*  Select Connect Board Component
*  Check the box next to "clock_CLK_IN1" and click OK
*  Double click on the clk_wiz_0 block in the block diagram
*  On the Board Tab, make sure that CLK_IN1 has sys clock selected
*  For EXT_RESET_IN select reset

<img src = "{% link media/microblaze/Clock_interface.png %}" width="800">

*  Select Output Clocks tab
*  Make sure that the clk_out1 box is checked and that the Requested Frequency is 100 MHz
*  Select Active Low for the Reset Type

*  Click OK
*  Click "Run Connection Automation"
*  Make sure the resetn box is checked

<img src = "{% link media/microblaze/connection_automation.png %}" width="800">

*  Click OK
*  In the Board tab, right click on USB UART
*  Select Connect Board Component
*  Select AXI Uartlite -> UART
*  Click OK
  *  You can double click the new UART Block to check the UART settings
*  Click the "Add IP" (Plus sign at the top of the block diagram)
*  Search Microblaze
*  Double click microblaze
*  Click Run Block Automation
*  Set Local Memory to 32 KB
*  Click OK
*  Click Run Connection Automation
*  Check the box next to All Automation
*  Click OK
## Generate Bitstream
*  Click the Validate design button
*  Click OK
*  On the sources tab, right click your block design and select Create HDL Wrapper
*  Check Let Vivado manage wrapper and auto-update
*  Click OK
*  Under the Flow Navigator select "Generate Bitstream"
*  Click Yes
*  Click OK
*  Wait
*  On the next pop up click Cancel
*  In the File drop-down select Export, then Export Hardware,
*  Click Next
*  Check Include bitstream and click Next
*  Choose a name for your XSA filename and click Next
  * I named mine dh_microblaze and saved it to /home/danh444/microblaze_tutorial/microblaze
* Click Finish
## Program Board
* Click Open Hardware Manager -> Open Target -> Auto Connect
* Click Program Device -> xc7a100t_0
* Click Program
## Launch Vitis
*  Run Vitis (`vitis`) in terminal window
*  Choose a Workspace and click Launch
## Create the Platform Project
*  Click File -> New -> Platform Project
*  Choose a name for the platform project
*  Click Next
*  Under Hardware Specification, Browse to the XSA file you created
*  Click Finish
## Create the Application Project
*  Click File -> New -> Application Project
*  Click Next
*  Select the platform you created
*  Choose an application project name
*  Click Next
*  Choose Empty Application C++
*  Click Finish
*  Under your new application project, right click on src and click add file.

<img src = "{% link media/microblaze/src_directory.png %}" width="800">

*  Name it main.cpp and click Finish
*  Add the following simple program
```
#include <stdio.h>  
int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
}
```
*  Save the file
*  Right-click on your application project and select build project
## Connect to UART
*  In order to see the program output you need to connect to the board UART
*  Open a separate terminal
*  Enter the following command
  * python3 -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyUSB1 9600 
## Application
*  Right-click on your application project and select run as -> Launch on Hardware (Single application debug)
*  You should see the message *Hello World* in the UART terminal
