Markdown is useful for taking notes and is frequently used in GitHub repositories for the `README.md` and other descriptive pages.

## Basics

```
This is how you make words **bold** 
and other words *italic* with Markdown. 
And this is how you make a [link to Google!](https://google.com)

Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear crossed out.

```

### Images
Images are similar to links to other pages, but with an `!` in front, and a link to the location of your image.

On your Jekyll website, you'll want to use the format below instead.

```
<img src = "{% link media/Basys-3.png %}" width="600">
```
<img src = "{% link media/Basys-3.png %}" width="600">

To work with Markdown from within VS Code, download the `Github Markdown Preview` Extension. 

Then you can click the `Open Preview to the Side` Icon on the top right of the editing window to open the preview of the Markdown you have open.

Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see what the page will actually look like on a jekyll server.
