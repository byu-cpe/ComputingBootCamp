### Background

**RapidWright** is a (mostly) open-source Java tool that provides you with a programming interface to Vivado designs. RapidWright contains its own Java classes to represent Xilinx FPGA devices, netlists, and how a netlist is implemented on the FPGA device. RapidWright interacts with Vivado through Xilinx `.dcp` (Design Checkpoint) and `.edf` (Electronic Design Interchange Format) files. You can create designs in Vivado, export them to a checkpoint and import them into RapidWright for analysis or modifications. The reverse process is also possible.

Although **RapidWright** is written in Java (available at [Xilinx/RapidWright](https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright)), it is possible to access the Java classes and methods directly from Python using the **JPype** tool. Setting up this environment takes only a few minutes, and instructions are provided [here](https://www.rapidwright.io/docs/Install_RapidWright_as_a_Python_PIP_Package.html).

### Starter Code

Hereâ€™s a basic Python script that opens a design and prints the number of cells and nets:

```
import jpype
import jpype.imports
from jpype.types import *

jpype.startJVM(classpath=["rapidwright-2021.2.1-standalone-lin64.jar"])

from com.xilinx.rapidwright.design import Design

def main():
    d = Design.readCheckpoint("design.dcp", "design.edf")

    print("Number of Cells:", len(d.getCells()))
    print("Number of Nets:", len(d.getNets()))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

For this code to work, you will need to download `rapidwright-2021.2.1-standalone-lin64.jar` from the [RapidWright Releases Page](https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright/releases). You will also need to provide a `design.dcp` and `design.edf` file. These can be obtained from Vivado by running the following commands:

```
write_checkpoint <filename>.dcp
write_edif <filename>.edf 
```

You should place all these files (including the `rapidwright-2021.2.1-standalone-lin64.jar` file) into your project directory along with your python script. The output of the script should look something like this:

```
