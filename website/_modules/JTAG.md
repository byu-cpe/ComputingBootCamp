# JTAG

In an effort to create a standardized way to access the internals of increasingly small circuits for testing and manufacturing, the Joint Test Action Group created the industry standard *JTAG*. This standard became official in 1990. Testing PCB's from the outside was becoming infeasible, and so JTAG provides a standardized way to see what is going on in a circuit without having to use big traditional electronic tools.


Some Vocabulary:
*JTAG* is the interface
*Boundary Scan* is the test tech where cells are placed on I/O pins
*1149.1* is the standard

“The IEEE standard defines the Test Access Port (TAP), a sequential state machine called the TAP controller that’s implemented in the IC, the Instruction Register, and a number of Data Registers.” See more [here](https://www.jtag.com/ieee-1149-1/)

TAP (Test access port) includes the following:

TDI (Test Data In)
TDO (Test Data Out)
TCK (Test Clock)
TMS (Test Mode Select)
TRST (Test Reset) optional.

Here is a really helpful animation to understand the state machine, the registers, and the modes.

You can chain several JTAG devices together by their JTAG ports.

We use JTAG in Dr. Wirthlin's lab to effectively read status registers and configure, among other things.
