* When running with Tcl, DO NOT work inside the Vivado-created project directory.  Copy the files outside to a new location. You don't want to mix project mode and non-project mode stuff.

* Windows 10 users: If you are unable to get access to the papers listed on any of these pages and set up a CAEDM vpn using the windows 10 instructions, use the instructions for windows 8 instead.
