Jake Edvenson,edvenson,0EB535295,3,100,1,A,"6",1,"I think the video was relatively clear about how to make the parser, however it would be helpful to have a little bit more info on the parser that is wanted. Can it handle multiple column entries or only one? What does verbose mean exactly? If verbose is off, does the data still get printed to the screen? If so, what does verbose effect?",1,
