Based on the attitude I've noticed in the lab among the newest folks, some examples of how powerful the terminal is for normal tasks might help inspire people to jump in with a bit more enthusiasm.",1,

I feel like it went just enough in depth that I'm able to write simple bash scripts to make my job much easier. I think it'd be nice to have an activity asking the user to write their own bash script, I found that this helped me become acustomed to linux much faster.",1,

ln -a
ln -t

those can be combined to etiher
ln -at
ln -ta
ln -a -t

and all of those will work the same (or at least I think they will)",1,

A way to improve this might have been to give us a mini project or file that we would have to make some edits on and then in connection with the next module to add it to a git repository and pull request it to github or something. Maybe a continuing project would help us to see more of how each of these things connect together.",1,

I had to look up some things on the internet to get that work. I am not sure if that was the intended goal, but if not I would think that that section needs some modification. I think that it would also be helpful to include a tutorial about how to download and install app onto the computer.
